Hi, my name is Ulyana, I'm 39 and I'm a junior front-end developer.

I graduated from the Bonch-Bruevich Saint-Petersburg State University of Telecommunications and worked in the field of IT, but it was not related to frontend development. I worked as telecommunication engineer, system administration and my groups in social network. I was not satisfied with my work, so I passed the testing QA course. Where the topic of programming js was touched and I liked it so much! And currently I'm attending the RSSchool frontend course.

I like the fact that programming is a clear set of instructions, which at the same time gives you unlimited space for implementation. And you can create everything and see the result of your work.

Studying is quite difficult to me, a lot of material and new information.
But at the same time it is very interesting.
All the last time, several months, has been monotonous and routine for me behind a black screen on my laptop. And this despite the fact that due to the situation in the world I am forced to change relocations: the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia ... and this is not the end!

I like it and it gives me pleasure! So I plan to continue to develop in this direction every day, step by step!

Minesweeper Latest Educational Project: I didn’t know where to start for a long time, I looked at materials, a lot of videos and an infinite number of web pages.
And when, as a result, you see a finished product that works, but not without errors, it may not be possible to implement everything, but still the result is definitely pleasing.
And to hear from your children: “Let moms play some more, cool!” - Motivates you to keep moving forward.

What else am I doing? in my free time...it's my hobby, I run. I love running, I love long slow runs.
It helps me relax, unwind and reset my brain, and keep me fit, of course!

Thank you!
